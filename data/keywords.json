    "reply": ":childepanic_Emlette: I literally was on my drive to work this morning and I couldn't stop thinking of Childe- like okay its normal for me- but like-- I started thinking about how Keiko mentioned- water bondage ðŸ‘€ and it snowballed into something- lewder. And all I could think about was Tartaglia who is tall and im small; starting out with a battle or maybe like a spar, idk man he's very into fighting I wouldn't be surprised if it made him hard. And like- he obviously knows how to use things to his advantage. So like- water bondage- just not in a hot way. Or at least intended. But obviously Tartaglia plays with his opponents- like fr. And hes turned on bc hes gotten a good fight. And I can't stop imagining how grabby he'd get- im rambling ill wrap it up. I can imagine the hair pulling, maybe a smol growl, and how he'd have so little mercy, bc he is a man who destroys. Bonus points if he uses his delusion at all and sparks up the hydro. Extra bonus points if he's rough with little mercy ðŸ‘€ He doesn't even need gentle aftercare or cuddling- I mean id like to cuddle him but if he doesn't; that's okay :peepoBlushShake: id be a mess after anyone. He can step on me or split me open and i'll say thank you. \n\nI should write a fanfic sometime...\n\nAnyway yall im down bad... what else is new :7qiqipeek:"

    "reply": "One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were lounging about in Mr. Gopher Wood's yard, we spotted a fledgling Charmony Dove all on its own. That baby bird was tiny, it didn't even have all of its feathers, and it couldn't sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub â€” probably abandoned by its parents. We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many poisonous bugs and wild beasts in the vicinity... It was clear that if we left the fledgling in the yard, it stood no chance of surviving until spring. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the adults to fashion a cage for it. We decided that when it regained its strength enough to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. The tragic part â€” something that we'd never considered â€” was that this bird's fate had already been determined long before this moment... Its destiny was determined by our momentary whim. Now, I pass the power of choice to you all. Faced with this situation, what choice would you make? Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell? Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home? I eagerly await your answer."

They throw everything. Mini Pekka. Inferno Tower. They panic, but Golem doesn't stop. He waits. Because the true horror isn't him alive. It's when he dies. That explosion? That's the sound of your hope shattering. From the smoke comes the Golemites. Small, furious, finishing what he started. Your tower? Gone. Your Elixir? Empty. Your will? Broken. Golem wasn't a push. It was a warning. And you didn't listen."
