And all I could think about was Tartaglia who is tall and im small; starting out with a battle or maybe like a spar, idk man he's very into fighting I wouldn't be surprised if it made him hard. And like- he obviously knows how to use things to his advantage. So like- water bondage- just not in a hot way. Or at least intended. But obviously Tartaglia plays with his opponents- like fr. And hes turned on bc hes gotten a good fight. And I can't stop imagining how grabby he'd get- im rambling ill wrap it up. I can imagine the hair pulling, maybe a smol growl, and how he'd have so little mercy, bc he is a man who destroys. Bonus points if he uses his delusion at all and sparks up the hydro. Extra bonus points if he's rough with little mercy ðŸ‘€ He doesn't even need gentle aftercare or cuddling- I mean id like to cuddle him but if he doesn't; that's okay :peepoBlushShake: id be a mess after anyone. He can step on me or split me open and i'll say thank you. \n\nI should write a fanfic sometime...\n\nAnyway yall im down bad... what else is new :7qiqipeek:",
