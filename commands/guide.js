            ## since you are stupid and you need to learn common sense, let's teach you how to play silverwolf bot!

            1. \`/claim\` - this is how you earn dinonuggies. There is a low chance that it will have a bonus attached to it. If you hit the bonus, you'll earn more.
            2. \`/eat\` and \`/eatmultiple\` - Eating is the easiest early game tactic to gain mystic credits.
            3. \`/upgrades\` - Upgrades are the best way to increase your dinonuggie earnings.
            4. \`/slots\` - The meta way to earn dinonuggies. Make a bet and spin away! The natural statistical earnings from this are 70%, just gamble and you'll increase.
            5. \`/blackjack\` and \`/roulette\` are other great alternatives.
            6. \`/upgradedata\` to see how much mystic credits are needed for each upgrade.
            7. Once you're maxed out to level 30, you can increase your cap via \`/ascend\`.

            The grind doesn't stop! Rahhh!
